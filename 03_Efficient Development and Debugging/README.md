## Introduction
<hr>

In this section we are going to get to making sure you understand how to check your code for errors and how to approach oin fixing them and making sure you look as professional as possible 

Here are the focal points of this section:

1. Write Code Efficiently
    - Work in a productive environment (i.e. IDE editor)
    - Auto-format code and use shortcuts
    - Auto-completion and hints
    - Explore extensions and settings

2. How to Find Help
    - [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
    - Learn hot to Google
    - Learn how to ask proper questions, **HELP OTHERS**
    - Trial and Error

3. Debug Your Code
    - Read and utilize your error messages
    - Use `console.log()` to gain insights into your code
    - Use debugging tools, provided in your browser
    - Use your IDEs debugging capabilities



This repo was created with the presumption that you have some basic understanding using `VS Code`, I have attached a link for you to review how to make settings changes in your IDE

Everyone needs to find a way to work with their IDE for themselves, its just the way it is and there are no notes to this that you will find here, Please visit the `VS Code documentation`

## The ECMAScript Standard
<hr>

ECMAScript (the language "behind" JavaScript) is under active development and the current progress and active standard is of course documented.

You find a link on this page: [EMCAScript Standard](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)

Please note: This document is absolutely NOT meant to be learned by heart or to be used as a developer. Rather it's important to browser vendors.

Still, if you're interested in getting a glimpse behind the scenes, this document might be interesting.

## How To Google Correctly
<hr>

It is very important to understand what the scope of your knowledge, It can be easy to forget the name of a `method` or `logic` you might want help with, 

for example if you cant remember the `parseInt()` maybe try running a google search like:

**JavaScript Convert String to Number**

But including **JavaScript** we are already narrowing down our search tto find the solution to our preferred programming language

Generally the search will return many solutions or blogs and forums (i.e. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)) where many users have probably been in your shoes before

## Error Messages
<hr>

Finding errors are generally simple, in your `IDE` (i.e. VS Code), you will generally be alerted in several places where your code might have an error or if you might have had a spelling error too, that will be easier to spot than the next problem

If you get no errors in your IDE and your run your code and the application functions do not execute as you intended (which is generally normal), all you have to to is open up your `developer tools`,  usually there is an `error message` that is displayed  in the `console`, you can use that to successfully debug your code

# JavaScript: The Complete Guide

This is GitHub Repo to demonstrate how to read, use and understand the programming Language of JavaScript as taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/)

I found his style of teaching to be the most thorough and clear and I have created this repo with extensive notes to understanding the concepts and practices behind using and excelling in `JavaScript`

This repo is set out in sections and each section has its own individual `README.md` file which explicitly explains all the core fundamentals being demonstrated as he teaches it but just with my `study notes`, please feel free to add to this repo if you can see of an easier way to explain the theory of the work

Sections may contain **"mini-projects"** where the code will obtain comments that explain the programme from top to bottom

I thought this would be a great way to try help the community as we all learn and understand this differently!

Enjoy!

## Future Release

1. Upon completion of this course I will create a Landing page which will make for easy navigation to areas you need to see and access code

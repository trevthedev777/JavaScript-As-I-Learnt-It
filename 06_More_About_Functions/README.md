## Introduction

<hr>

We have been using functions in all our mini projects up until now but there are many more things that functions can do in `JavaScript`. In this section we are going to have a look at:

-   Different Ways of Creating Functions
-   Anonymous Functions
-   Callback Functions & Functions in Functions
-   Default Arguments & Rest Operator
-   bind() & More

## Recapping: What We Already Know

<hr>

Functions are constructs which allow us to create "Code on Demand", when JavaScript reads our script, it loads all our function declarations, registers them and then it executes the script

If you can recall when we learned about `Block Scope Variables`, that, Variables and Constants that are created in functions **belong** to that function

Functions **CAN** take parameters/arguments and **CAN** return a value, you can write functions that don't need these but some functions work better with these specific requirements.

Functions can be called multiple times with different arguments, it's dynamic which means that you can call your function, add a different argument and that function will still work. So the same function

Functions can be called "directly" or "indirectly"

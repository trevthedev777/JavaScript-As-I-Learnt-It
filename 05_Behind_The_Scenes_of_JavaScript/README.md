## ES5 vs ES6

What is this? ES = `ECMAScript`, which the language specification, it is the language behind JavaScript the official documentation can be found here [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/)

Although is not pivotal to know this, it could be helpful to read through it one day when you have time, this is more aimed at browser vendors

It is always under active development.

ECMAScript dates back to the 90s, the first popular version was `ECMAScript 5`

Things evolved and in around 2015 `ECMAScript 6` was released and we can safely classify that as `Modern JavaScript`, features are always getting added to browsers incrementally

Older browsers are being phased out and we can see a modernization and standard of it all. This course features on `ES6`.

**Interesting facts about ES5**:

-   You could only declare variables using the `var` keyword, you could not use `const` or `let` as that was only introduced in `ES6`
-   Generally `ES5` uses the same syntax but misses a lot of crucial features

**Interesting facts about ES6**:

-   Supported in modern browsers, can (mostly) be transpiled to `ES5`
-   Many new features that help us write cleaner, better and faster code
-   `ES13` is the latest release as of the time of this README and was released on **June 22 2022**
-   Still under active development but `ES6` was the big breakthrough for JavaScript

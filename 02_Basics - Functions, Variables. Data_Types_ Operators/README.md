## Introduction
<hr>

In this application, we demonstrate the use of the `let` and `const` and how and when to use them

### The let Keyword
<hr>

The `let` keyword is used to declare data stored into a variable that is able to update its originally declared value throughout the project

Example:
```
let userName = 'Trevor';
console.log(userName); // 'Trevor'

userName = 'Trevor Lehmann';
console.log(userName); // 'Trevor Lehmann' 
```

### The const Keyword
<hr>

The `const` keyword is a variable/data-container that can not be changed in the project, the original value of the variable will remain the same through out

Example:
```
let totalUsers = 15;
console.log(totalUsers); // 15

totalUsers = 20;
console.log(totalUsers); // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

_use `constants as often as possible` (i.e whenever you actually have data that never changes) to be clear about your intentions (in your code)_

## Declaring and Naming Variables
<hr>

Before we begin, it is important to know that `JavaScript` is a case-sensitive programming language and that you should keep that in mind when re-using your variables throughout your application

### **Allowed/Disallowed, Best and Worst Practices in `JavaScript`**

Allowed | Best Practices | Disallowed | Bad Practices
--------|----------------|------------|--------------
`let` userName | **camelCase** | `let` user_name | Allowed but bad practice
`let` ageGroup5 | Only letters and numbers | `let` 21Players | Starting digits **NOT** allowed
`let` $kindOfSpecial | Starting with $ is allowed | `let` user-b | No special characters (i.e - and whitespace)
`let` _internalValue | Starting with `_` is allowed | `let` let | Keywords **NOT** allowed

## Working with variables and Basic Operators
<hr>

### What are Operators?

It is a syntax feature in `JavaScript` that allows us to manipulate values

Operators | Name of Operator | Function | Example  
----------|------------------|----------|--------
`+` | Addition Operator | Adds Two Numbers | 2 + 2 = 4
`-` | Subtraction Operator |Subtracts Two Numbers | 4 - 2 = 2
`*` | Multiplication Operator |Multiplies Two Numbers | 4 * 4 = 16
`/` | Division Operator | Divides Two Numbers | 4 / 4 = 1 
`%` | Modulus Operator |Divides Two Numbers, returns remainder | 4 % 3 = 1
`**`| Exponentiation Operator | Multiplies itself to itself a number of given times | 2 ** 3 = 8

## Data Types in JavaScript
<hr>

### Numbers & Strings

#### Numbers

Numbers are important for calculations and with code where you need to _"work with a number"_.

In JavaScript you get different types of numbers to work with:

Integers | Floats
---------|--------
2 or -3  | 22.265 

#### Strings (Text)

Strings are important for outputting results, gathering input

You can generate `Strings` using either:

- '' (Single Quotes)
- "" (Double Quotes) 
- `` (Back Ticks - _usually used with template literals_)

You can use whichever you want, just always be consistent

Another rule with `JavaScript` syntax is that you can not open a `String` with one type of quote and close it as another

#### String Template Literal

`JavaScript` has a special operation that it can perform with the `backtick`, this is used to create a `Template Literal` and this is where you can create `Strings` and accessing `variables output` into your output text, you can also write `multi-line strings` using the template literal method

Example:
```
const defaultResult = 0;
let currentResult = defaultResult; // 0

currentResult = (currentResult + 10) * 3 / 2 - 1;

let calculationDescription = `(${defaultResult} + 10) * 3 / 2 - 1`;
console.log(calculationDescription) // (0 + 10) * 3 / 2 - 1
```

## Functions in JavaScript
<hr>

A `function` is a language construct which is used in programming languages which allows you to:

1. Define a function
```
function greetUser(name) {  
    alert('Hi ' + name);
};
```
_you can (but don't have to) use **parameters** (eg. name) and you can (but don't have to) return values (via **return**)_

The code does not run by itself, usually the code is loaded and "stored in memory" you will need to:

2. Call Function
```
greetUser('Trevor'); // Hi Trevor
```

You can call the function back as often as you want throughout your code with different parameters (if it takes parameters)

Every function execution then runs independent from other (possible) executions.

Always try to give your function a name that describes its use.

### Returning values in a function

This is the basic syntax of a basic addition function in JavaScript:

```
function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    const result = num1 + num2;
    return result;
}
```

This function contains two `parameters`, these are variables that are accessible only inside the function, the output of this function is to `return` the value of `num1 + num2`.

In order to get a result you need to `call` that function like this:

```
addNumbers(num1, num2); // NaN
```

For this example, you will not get a result if you pass just `num1` and `num2`, but you need to input two `numerical` values to add

```
addNumbers(5, 8); // 13
```

You can also update `values` and declare `variables` with your `function callbacks` as per this example:

```
const defaultResult = 0;

let currentResult = defaultResult;

function addNumbers(num1, num2) {
    const result = num1 + num2;
    return result;
}

currentResult = addNumbers(5 , 5);
console.log(currentResult); // 10
```

## The (Un)importance of Code order

When writing `JS` code, you need to keep the following in mind:

- you need to place your `const` and `let` variables above when you are referring to them in the script
- you can declare your functions anywhere in the Script and call them anywhere, this is a special feature that is used in JavaScript
